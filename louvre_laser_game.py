# Kiosk streaming mode
# =============================================================================
# The kiosk browser cannot embed a native cv2.imshow() window, so this is a
# second entry point that reuses every bit of the detection/scoring/HUD logic
# above but yields MJPEG frames instead of opening a desktop window. Flask
# wraps this generator in a multipart/x-mixed-replace response and the browser
# displays it with a plain <img> tag - no video-streaming library needed on
# either side.
#
# run_game() above is left completely untouched: `python louvre_laser_game.py`
# still opens a native window for standalone development and testing per
# AGENTS.md. This function is only ever called from inside the Flask process.
#
# Differences from run_game(), all forced by having no keyboard/mouse and no
# native window:
#   - Starts immediately in COUNTDOWN. There is no IDLE/click-to-start state -
#     the kiosk's own "launch" click is what causes the browser to open this
#     stream in the first place.
#   - There is no cv2.waitKey() to read, because the crew is looking at a browser
#     tab and not at a native window: the keys run_game() binds (R restart,
#     N skip, Q quit) cannot reach this process at all. The kiosk page sends
#     those same three actions over HTTP instead - see request_stream_command()
#     below and /api/game/control in backend/app.py.
# =============================================================================

# Kiosk control channel ------------------------------------------------------
# The browser cannot deliver keystrokes to OpenCV, so the kiosk POSTs a command
# and the streaming loop picks it up on its next frame. Keyed by room, not by
# crew: one laptop serves one room and one crew at a time (see run.md), so the
# room is the session, and a stale command from a previous crew cannot be
# delivered to the next one because the key is overwritten, not queued.
